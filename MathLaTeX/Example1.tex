The foundations of the rigorous study of \textit{analysis} were laid in the 
nineteenth century, notably by the mathematicians Cauchy and Weierstrass. 
Central to the study of this subject are the formal definitions of 
\textit{limits} and \textit{continuity}.

Let $D$ be a subset of $\bf R$ and let $f \colon D \to \textbf{R}$ be 
a real-valued function on $D$. The function $f$ is said to be \textit{continuous} on $D$ 
if, for all $\epsilon > 0$ and for all $x \in D$, there exists some $\delta > 0$ 
(which may depend on $x$) such that if $y \in D$ satisfies 
\[ |y - x| < \delta \] 
then 
\[ |f(y) - f(x)| < \epsilon. \]

One may readily verify that if $f$ and $g$ are continuous functions on $D$ then 
the functions $f+g$, $f-g$ and $f.g$ are continuous. 
If in addition $g$ is everywhere non-zero then $f/g$ is continuous.

Experienced \TeX{} users are \TeX perts, and know how to use whitespaces. % renders correctly

Some commands require a parameter, which has to be given between curly braces { } after the command name.
